    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>450g chicken breast (about 2 breasts), cubed</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2cm piece peeled fresh ginger, minced</li>
        <li>15ml soy sauce</li>
        <li>25g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>10g teaspoon cornflour</li>
        <li>7g salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>15ml dry sherry</li>
        <li>15ml dark sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>450g broccoli, trimmed sliced stalks<br>
             (about .5cm thick) and medium florets <br>
             (keep the 2 cuts separate)</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Toss the chicken with about half the garlic and ginger, the soy sauce, sugar, 1 teaspoon of the cornflour, 5g of the salt, the sherry, and the sesame oil in a bowl. Marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes. Mix the remaining cornflour with the 80ml broth or water.</li>
      <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoons of the oil and heat. Add the broccoli stems, and stir-fry for 1 min. Add the florets and the remaining garlic, ginger, 30ml of water, and season with pinch of salt, and pepper, to taste. Stir-fry until the broccoli is bright green but still crisp, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</li>
      <li>Heat the skillet again, and add 2 more tablespoons of oil. Add the chicken and stir-fry until the chicken loses its raw color and gets a little brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Return the broccoli to the pan and toss to heat through. Stir in the reserved cornflour mixture and bring to a boil to thicken. Add more water to thin the sauce, if necessary. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if you like. Mound the stir-fry on a serving platter or divide among 4 plates; serve with rice.</li>
